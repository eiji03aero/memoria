# Mobile app approach
## General
- To implement native mobile apps, we want to decide which framework / language to take.

    - Unity has pretty good lineup for what has been used
        - Pokemon GO, Umamusume, Fate GO
    - Xamarin is by microsoft
    - RN for fb, ig, uber eats
    - Flutter not so much, Grab
    - Native UI
        - RN
    - Original
        - Flutter
        - Unity
    - Combination for UI
        - Xamarin

## Flutter vs React Native
- Cross platform is the way
    - there is no way to learn and build whole 2 different platforms
- Hybrid is not the way
    - but I do want to learn something new
- Why flutter
    - Has better hot reloading, thus better DX
    - Can be fun to learn new language, new framework
    - Better capability to implement customized UIs
    - Consistent UX
- Why RN
    - Should be faster to implement
    - As a react engineer, it can compliment my skillset

## Conclusion
- Go with flutter
    - simply there are more ups
    - and I want to learn something new
    - RN sounds like I can try it whenever

# UI library for flutter
## Comparison

## Conclusion
- Go with material package
    - Should be reliable enough as it is officially provided
    - To make most of cross platform, focused on one package should be the best choise
