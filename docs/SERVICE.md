# About the service
## Service core concepts
### Thoughts
- What about create this to share with others
    - Me to create and share with families like Osakabe's and Boudoux's
    - The motivation is to create memories data to share with those who did not attend the memory
    - Rather than create them for yourself
- Bringing family sides together
    - for example my family and connie's family
- Time-capsule the love for your family and friends

### Concepts
- Organize memory on this app to share with your family / friends

### What pain to solve?
- Memory sharing resolution is not really high
- Memory gets lost from people's brain


## Feature idea brain storming
- Memory map
    - visual representation of memory
    - User can freely edit them
- Audio Narratives
    - Allow users to add voice notes or background music to their memories.
    - Something like 30 seconds diary?
- Memory Capsules
    - Allow users to create time-locked memories that can only be accessed after a certain date.
- Interactive family tree
    - visual faimly tree
    - add and view memories per member
- Memory dashboard
    - A dynamic dashboard showing recent activities, new memories, and upcoming events within the family.
- Memory slides
    - Allow user to create memory slides
    - Like a simplified version of powerpoint
    - Probably making it public to internet so that anyone can access
- Memory Revival
    - On This Day: Remind users of memories from the same date in past years.
    - Encourage user to do the same thing as that memory

## Balancing Free and Premium Features idea
- Free Plan (80% Usability)
    - Core Features
        - Create and view albums/collections
        - Upload and share photos and videos
        - Comment on and react to memories
        - Basic search and tagging
    - Limited Advanced Features
        - Limited cloud storage (e.g., 5GB)
        - Basic AI features (e.g., basic photo tagging, simple photo editing)
        - Limited number of collaborative albums (e.g., up to 3 joint albums)
- Premium Plan
    - Enhanced Features
        - Ad-free experience
        - Unlimited cloud storage
        - Advanced AI features (e.g., facial recognition, sentiment analysis, advanced search)
        - Unlimited collaborative albums
        - Exclusive themes and customization options
        - Priority support and early access to new features

## Pricing strategy for premium plan
To decide on a competitive yet reasonable pricing strategy, let's look at similar services and their pricing:
- Google Photos
    - Free: 15GB of storage
    - Paid: $1.99/month (100GB), $2.99/month (200GB), $9.99/month (2TB)
- Dropbox
    - Free: 2GB of storage
    - Paid: $9.99/month (2TB)
- Evernote
    - Free: Basic features with limited uploads
    - Paid: $7.99/month (Premium features)

Given that your app offers unique AI capabilities and a tailored private experience, a competitive price point could be:
- Basic Premium Plan: $2.99/month (300 yen/month) - This would include enhanced storage, ad-free experience, and basic AI features.
- Advanced Premium Plan: $5.99/month (600 yen/month) - This would offer unlimited storage, advanced AI features, exclusive themes, and priority support.

## How do we keep users engaged with the app?
- If I could implement features that help users to create and store memories easily, they should naturally come to this app and engage whenever.
